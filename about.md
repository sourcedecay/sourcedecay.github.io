Hi, I'm sourcedecay and this is a place where I ramble about things that interest me, including sewing, photography, cooking, and coding.


_Sewing_

I've been sewing since 2012 and the majority of my wardrobe are things that I made. I enjoy both taking my time with precise projects and getting quick satisfaction with patterns that I have made several times before. I recently purchased a few books on tailoring and I am excited to make a very sharp suit.


_Photography_

I love the look, process, and unpredictability of film photography and have a closet full of cameras that I love for different reasons. My first camera (as an adult) was a Holga 120N and is still a favorite when I want a dreamy effect from vignettes and light leaks.


_Cooking_

My diet can be described as mostly plant-based with the occasional egg, fish sauce, and butter and I cook a lot of food typically from India, South East Asia (Thai, Vietnamese), and South Korea. My partner and I recently started exploring Sichuan cuisine and it has been fun to add those flavors to our spice cabinet.


_Coding_

In some areas of my life, I am exact and consistent, but that is definitely not how I code. I am trying to make my hacking more coherent especially since code I write for work is integrated into a codebase. I'm am hoping to use this space to document techniques that I keep looking up.
