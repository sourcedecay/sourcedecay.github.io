Hi, I'm sourcedecay and I am trying to make sure that I am building myself toward the person I want to be. I'm using this space to document that movement (and so I can refer back to code snippets that I keep having to look up...)

I'm looking to grow in the following areas:
- Intellectually
  - Learn Spanish
  - Continue learning Python and other coding languages


- Creatively
  - Continue sewing a handmade wardrobe
  - Increase film and digital photography skills
  - Continue to try new recipes and techniques in the kitchen


- Socially
  - Maintain connections with current friends
  - Create local community and network
  - Find people who share my interests


- Physically
  - Maintain yoga/stretching practice
  - Increase strength and stamina
