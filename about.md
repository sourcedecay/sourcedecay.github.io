Hi, I'm sourcedecay and I am trying to make sure that I am building myself toward the person I want to be. I'm using this space to document that movement (and so I can refer back to code snippets that I keep having to look up...)

I'm looking to grow in the following areas:
- Intellectually: Activities that expand my mind
  - Learn Spanish
  - Keep learning Python and other coding languages
  
-
